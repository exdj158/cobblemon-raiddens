## Raiding
- The first person to join a raid will become the host.

- The host can accept and deny future join requests while the raid is active.
- All players can start their own battles simultaneously.
- The boss' health is synced across all battlers.
- Once your Pokemon has fainted, you cannot rejoin the battle, but you will still receive the rewards if the raid is cleared.
- Once the boss is defeated, you can receive the Pokemon in your chosen Pokeball, as well as a Raid Pouch with random item rewards.
